    <h3>Contribution</h3>
    <p>Dr. Asakawa’s contributions to technology include her innovations in building accessible technology. Her
        inventions were a huge support to visually impaired users who could become an active part of the digital
        world too. She developed IBM’s Home Page Reader. This was one of the first web browsers developed
        for those visually impaired. This gave them access to the internet through a “web-to-speech” (Chieko
        Asakawa | IBM, n.d.) system.
        Such a contribution to technology can be related to the pillar of sociotechnical thinking. Sociotechnical
        thinking focuses on understanding how technology interacts with human and social needs, ensuring that
        innovations serve a broad and inclusive audience. Dr. Asakawa’s work on IBM’s Home Page Reader
        directly addresses the needs of the visually impaired population, illustrating how technology can be
        adapted to meet the needs of underrepresented populations.By providing access to the Internet and
        increasing their digital engagement, she helped foster a more digitally inclusive environment.
        Relating it to technology today, we have tools that make it accessible to as many people as possible.
        Apple’s VoiceOver is a feature built on the same foundation as that of IBM's Home Page Reader,
        developed by Dr. Asakawa. It allows visually impaired users to navigate the Internet, read emails, and
        interact with digital content through audio feedback.</p>
    <h3>Future Promise</h3>
    <p>The future of accessibility technology, inspired by Chieko Asakawa's contributions, holds significant
        promise through advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, which will enhance
        user experiences by enabling more intuitive interactions, such as real-time speech recognition and
        translation for those with hearing impairments. Improved natural language processing (NLP) will lead to
        more accurate and context-aware screen readers, providing personalized reading experiences.
        Additionally, the rise of the Internet of Things (IoT) will create smarter environments, allowing
        individuals with disabilities to navigate their surroundings more easily through connected devices that
        offer feedback and alerts. Technologies like augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) will also play
        a crucial role, providing immersive experiences tailored to users' needs, helping bridge the gap between
        them and the physical world. As awareness of accessibility issues grows, wider adoption of universal
        design principles will ensure that all digital products are inherently accessible, reducing the reliance on
        separate assistive technologies. Furthermore, ongoing advocacy efforts will likely result in more policies
        and regulations promoting accessibility standards, leading to increased funding for the development of
        new assistive technologies. By focusing on these advancements, we can create a more inclusive digital
        landscape that serves everyone, regardless of their abilities.</p>
